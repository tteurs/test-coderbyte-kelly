SuppressionList is an application that consists of a selection of lists that are uploaded by the user which are then used to check against. For example, I might upload a list of phone numbers that I should not call. If I am buying leads, I could then check if a phone number is on that list before I call it.

This is code for handling creating lists from CSV files. There are two tests that are not passing. Two are errors, the other is a failure.

Take a look at the code in the `/jobs` directory along with `main.rb`. See what needs to be refactored or improved upon.
